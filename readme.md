# Make It Rain (Game Jam Prototype)

## Context

This jam was planned with a developer friend, and was set to be done within **72 hours** with the following theme: **make it rain**!  
We both have experience with Godot Engine and wanted to improve our skills in 3D games, specially with this engine. However, our programming background was different as I am specialized in .NET technologies, and my friend in scripting languages like GDScript. That is why we set two restrictions:

- It must be a first person shooter.
- It must be able to run both C# and GDScript.

## Interesting things you can find inside this project

- C# / GDScript interoperability
- Custom-made resources in C# that are able to be detected by the editor
- A way to check the type of a node hooked to a GDScript file, in a C# context
- Multiple camera rendering using SubViewport, allowing to achieve the first person shooter feeling (the weapon is always rendered in foreground)
- Quaternion usage
- CharacterBody3D usage

## Additional notes

We agreed on good practices such as naming conventions, folder organization, and code organization, and have done our best to use it as much as possible. However, please be aware that some parts of the source code remain messy due to time restriction.
